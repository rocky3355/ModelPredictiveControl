# Model Predictive Control

The task of this project was to control a vehicle with MPC, instead of the PID controller used for the previous project. The simple kinematic model described in the lectures is used to predict the vehicle's path of motion. This model does not take forces like friction or slipping into account. The following equations are used for the model:
